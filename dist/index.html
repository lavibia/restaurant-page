Now remove those elements from the HTML (so leave only the <html>, <body>, and <div id="content"> tags) and instead create them by using JavaScript only, e.g. by appending each new element to div#content once the page is first loaded. Since we’re all set up to write our code in multiple files, let’s write this initial page-load function inside of its own module and then import and call it inside of index.js.

Next, set up your restaurant site to use tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu pages. Look at the behavior of this student solution for visual inspiration.

Put the contents of each ‘tab’ inside of its own module. Each module will export a function that creates a div element, adds the appropriate content and styles to that element and then appends it to the DOM.

Write the tab-switching logic inside of index.js. You should have event listeners for each tab that wipes out the current contents and then runs the correct ‘tab module’ to populate it again.

If you are using GitHub pages to host your completed page you need to do a tiny bit more work to get it to show up. After running webpack the full bundled version of your site is available in the dist folder, but GH pages is looking for an index.html in the root directory of your project.

Simply follow the instructions on this gist. EZPZ!
To prevent having to copy and paste the same lengthy git command each time, you can instead create an npm script to do the work for you!
Inside your project’s package.json file, within the scripts section, add an additional entry named something of your choosing and paste in the command from the above gist surrounded by quotation marks. Follow the formatting of the already added test script.
For Example:
"scripts": { "YourScriptName": "git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages" }
Now each time you need to update your project’s live preview, you can simply npm run <YourScriptName> in your project’s terminal.
To learn more about this, here’s a short tutorial video on Node Package Manager Scripts.
Recall that the source branch for GitHub Pages is set in your repository’s settings. -->
